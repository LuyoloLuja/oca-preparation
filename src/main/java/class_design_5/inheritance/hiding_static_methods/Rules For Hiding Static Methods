A hidden method occurs when a child class defines a static method with the same name and signature as a static method
defined in the parent class

Five rules of hiding static methods:
1. The method in the child class must have the same name and signature as the method in the parent class
2. The method in the child class must at least be as accessible or more accessible than the method in the parent class
3. The method in the child class may not throw new checked exception that is new or broader than the class of any thrown
   checked exception in the parent class
4. If the method returns a value, it must be the same or a subclass of the method in the parent class, 'covariant return types'
5. The method in the child class must be marked as static, if it is marked as static in the parent class
